# Student-database-schema
## Description:
This project is about designing a basic database for students and the courses they enroll in. It includes three tables: `students`, `courses`, and `enrollments`.

## Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench

## What I Did:
- Created a database named `StudentCourseDB`
- Made three tables:
  - `students` for student details
  - `courses` for course details
  - `enrollments` to link both using foreign keys
- Designed the ER diagram to show the relationships

## Relationships:
- One student can enroll in multiple courses
- One course can be taken by multiple students
- The `enrollments` table connects them both using foreign keys

## Output:
Successfully created all tables and linked them correctly. Diagram is also made.
